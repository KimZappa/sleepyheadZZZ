# sleepyheadZZZ
#DJ was here

4/5/19 Main program code is stored in sleepyhead.py you also need student.py,teacher.py,sleepy.py,awake.py
These files define the sprite objects and their functions. 
you need the images that represent each sprite 
download and save the music that plays while user is in first level, second level and when player crashes into a teacher
I added a second level which includes a third teacher and 6 sleeping students. There is now a main menu when the game begins or ends which either prompts the user to play or quit. 
if you have any questions or have issues with the code just let me know. -kim
